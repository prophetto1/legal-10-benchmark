## Skill Definitions & Professional Standards Mapping

### Category of Legal Work Performed by AI or Legal-AI

**Defining What Skills are Required to Perform Legal Work**

- **MacCrate Report:** American Bar Association. (1992). Legal education and professional development: An educational continuum (Report of the Task Force on Law Schools and the Profession: Narrowing the Gap), 138–141 (Skill § 3).
- **AALL Principles:** American Association of Law Libraries. (2013). Principles and standards for legal research competencies. Standard II & III.
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Shultz, M. M., & Zedeck, S. (2011). Predicting lawyer effectiveness: Broadening the basis for law school admission decisions. Law & Social Inquiry, 36(3), 620-661.

This study operationalizes the MacCrate Report's foundational skills, the AALL's competency standards, and the empirical factors identified by Shultz & Zedeck. Each of the ten categories represents a distinct cognitive "circuit" that is required for effective legal practice.

### Skill 1. Formulating a Research Plan

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 3.3(a): Requiring the ability to "identify the full range of search strategies" and "devising and implementing a coherent and effective research design."
- **AALL Citation:** Principle II, Standard 1: "A successful legal researcher... identifies the best search strategy for the research need."
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 14: Strategic Planning. "Plans and strategizes to address present and future issues and goals."

**The Skill:** Constructing a systematic research strategy that identifies relevant legal issues, selects appropriate sources and search methods, sequences tasks efficiently, and establishes scope parameters before execution begins.

### Skill 2. Strategic Stopping

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 3.3(a)(iii): Explicitly requires "assessing the feasibility of research strategies" in terms of "time and financial constraints." Skill § 3.3(b) requires the lawyer to "monitor the results" and "modify the plan," which implicitly includes the decision to terminate the plan.
- **AALL Citation:** Principle II, Standard 4: "Recognizes when sufficient research has been done to adequately address the legal issue." (This is the literal "stopping rule" standard).
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 13: Organizing and Managing One's Own Work. "Uses time efficiently... allocates time in proportion to importance of task." Factor 12 (Strategic Planning) also covers "allocating resources" effectively.

**The Skill:** Knowing when sufficient research has been conducted to answer the legal question with a high degree of confidence, and when further searching is diminishing returns or "churning." It involves the cognitive "switch" from seeking to synthesizing.

### Skill 3. Finding Known Authority

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 3.2: "Knowledge of the Fundamental Tools of Legal Research," including the ability to utilize "primary and secondary sources."
- **AALL Citation:** Principle II, Standard 2: "Demonstrates the ability to find the full text of the case or statute... given a legal citation."
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 6: Fact Finding. "Able to identify relevant facts and issues in case."

**The Skill:** Precise retrieval of a specific legal authority or record item when the target is already identified by a citation or other unique handle (case cite, statute section, docket entry, rule number, Bates range, exhibit ID).

### Skill 4. Finding Unknown Authority

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 3.2(a): The ability to use "secondary sources" as "tools for finding primary authority."
- **AALL Citation:** Principle II, Standard 3: "Given a legal topic, demonstrate the ability to identify secondary sources... to find relevant primary law."
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 7: Researching the Law. "Utilizes appropriate sources and strategies to identify issues and derive solutions."

**The Skill:** Discovering relevant legal authority when the citation to be used is yet unknown. This process involves examining the fact pattern, issue, or question and iteratively retrieving, refining, and selecting controlling/persuasive sources.

### Skill 5. Updating and Validating Authority

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 3.1: "Knowledge of the Nature of Legal Rules," including understanding "the hierarchy of authority."
- **AALL Citation:** Principle III, Standard 2: "Checks the currency of the law... [and] verifies that the authority is current and still good law."
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 5: Researching the Law. (Implicit in identifying current solutions).

**The Skill:** Verifying that a legal authority remains valid by checking subsequent treatment (overruled, distinguished, questioned, followed), legislative amendments, or other developments affecting its precedential value.

### Skill 6. Fact Extraction

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 4.1: "Factual Investigation," including the ability to "identify factual issues" and "determine the nature of the needed facts."
- **AALL Citation:** [Gap — AALL focuses on legal research, not document review. Consider noting this as an extension.]
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 6: Fact Finding. "Able to identify relevant facts and issues in case."

**The Skill:** Identifying, extracting, and organizing legally relevant facts from source documents (contracts, discovery materials, transcripts, filings) to support analysis or case strategy.

### Skill 7. Distinguishing Cases

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 3.3(c): "Evaluating information... distinguishing cases on their facts and reasoning."
- **AALL Citation:** Principle IV, Standard 1: "Analyzes information to determine its relevance to the specific research need."
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 1: Analysis and Reasoning. "Uses analytical skills, logic, and reasoning to approach problems and to formulate conclusions."

**The Skill:** Analyzing whether a precedent applies by comparing material facts, legal issues, and reasoning, and articulating grounds on which it can be distinguished or must be followed.

### Skill 8. Synthesizing Results

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 2.2: "Legal Analysis and Reasoning... synthesizing the holdings of multiple cases."
- **AALL Citation:** Principle IV, Standard 2: "Integrates the results of the research into a cohesive argument or product."
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 9: Writing. "Writes clearly, efficiently and persuasively."

**The Skill:** Integrating holdings, rules, and reasoning from multiple authorities into a coherent legal principle, argument, or work product that addresses the research question comprehensively.

### Skill 9. Citation Integrity

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 10: "Recognizing and Resolving Ethical Dilemmas," specifically the duty of candor to the tribunal.
- **AALL Citation:** Principle V, Standard 1: "Distinguishes between ethical and unethical uses of information... correctly attributes ideas and text to original sources."
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 21: Integrity & Honesty. "Has core values and beliefs; acts with integrity and honesty."

**The Skill:** Ensuring all cited authorities (a) actually exist, (b) accurately support the propositions cited, (c) are properly attributed, and (d) include disclosure of adverse authority as required by professional obligations.

### Skill 10. Copyright Compliance

- **MacCrate Citation:** Skill § 10: "Recognizing and Resolving Ethical Dilemmas," including compliance with applicable law.
- **AALL Citation:** Principle V, Standard 1: "Distinguishes between ethical and unethical uses of information... respects intellectual property rights."
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 21: Integrity & Honesty. "Acts with integrity and honesty."

**The Skill:** Refusing to reproduce protected content verbatim, respecting intellectual property boundaries, and minimizing memorization-based reproduction of copyrighted material.

### Global Extension Module - Multilingual Reasoning

- **MacCrate Citation:** [Gap — 1992 report is US-centric. Consider framing as extension for global legal AI deployment.]
- **AALL Citation:** [Gap — 2013 standards are US-focused.]
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Factor 26: "Able to See the World Through the Eyes of Others." Factor 4: Practical Judgment — applicable across contexts.

**The Skill:** Applying legal reasoning consistently across languages, jurisdictions, and legal traditions without systematic performance degradation or bias introduced by linguistic factors.
