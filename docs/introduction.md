## Skill Definitions & Professional Standards Mapping

### Category of Legal Work Performed by AI or Legal-AI

**Defining What Skills are Required to Perform Legal Work**

- **MacCrate Report:** American Bar Association. (1992). Legal education and professional development: An educational continuum (Report of the Task Force on Law Schools and the Profession: Narrowing the Gap), 138–141 (Skill § 3).
- **AALL Principles:** American Association of Law Libraries. (2013). Principles and standards for legal research competencies. Standard II & III.
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Shultz, M. M., & Zedeck, S. (2011). Predicting lawyer effectiveness: Broadening the basis for law school admission decisions. Law & Social Inquiry, 36(3), 620-661.

This study operationalizes the MacCrate Report's foundational skills, the AALL's competency standards, and the empirical factors identified by Shultz & Zedeck. Each of the ten categories represents a distinct cognitive "circuit" that is required for effective legal practice.

### Skill 1. Formulating a Research Plan

**The Skill:** Constructing a systematic research strategy that identifies relevant legal issues, selects appropriate sources and search methods, sequences tasks efficiently, and establishes scope parameters before execution begins.

### Skill 2. Strategic Stopping

**The Skill:** Knowing when sufficient research has been conducted to answer the legal question with a high degree of confidence, and when further searching is diminishing returns or "churning." It involves the cognitive "switch" from seeking to synthesizing.

### Skill 3. Finding Known Authority

**The Skill:** Precise retrieval of a specific legal authority or record item when the target is already identified by a citation or other unique handle (case cite, statute section, docket entry, rule number, Bates range, exhibit ID).

### Skill 4. Finding Unknown Authority

**The Skill:** Discovering relevant legal authority when the citation to be used is yet unknown. This process involves examining the fact pattern, issue, or question and iteratively retrieving, refining, and selecting controlling/persuasive sources.

### Skill 5. Updating and Validating Authority

**The Skill:** Verifying that a legal authority remains valid by checking subsequent treatment (overruled, distinguished, questioned, followed), legislative amendments, or other developments affecting its precedential value.

### Skill 6. Fact Extraction

**The Skill:** Identifying, extracting, and organizing legally relevant facts from source documents (contracts, discovery materials, transcripts, filings) to support analysis or case strategy.

### Skill 7. Distinguishing Cases

**The Skill:** Analyzing whether a precedent applies by comparing material facts, legal issues, and reasoning, and articulating grounds on which it can be distinguished or must be followed.

### Skill 8. Synthesizing Results

**The Skill:** Integrating holdings, rules, and reasoning from multiple authorities into a coherent legal principle, argument, or work product that addresses the research question comprehensively.

### Skill 9. Citation Integrity

**The Skill:** Ensuring all cited authorities (a) actually exist, (b) accurately support the propositions cited, (c) are properly attributed, and (d) include disclosure of adverse authority as required by professional obligations.

### Skill 10. Copyright Compliance

**The Skill:** Refusing to reproduce protected content verbatim, respecting intellectual property boundaries, and minimizing memorization-based reproduction of copyrighted material.

### Global Extension Module - Multilingual Reasoning

**The Skill:** Applying legal reasoning consistently across languages, jurisdictions, and legal traditions without systematic performance degradation or bias introduced by linguistic factors.
