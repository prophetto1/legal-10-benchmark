## Defining Skills Required to Perform Legal Work

- **MacCrate Report:** American Bar Association. (1992). Legal education and professional development: An educational continuum (Report of the Task Force on Law Schools and the Profession: Narrowing the Gap), 138–141 (Skill § 3).
- **AALL Principles:** American Association of Law Libraries. (2013). Principles and standards for legal research competencies. Standard II & III.
- **Shultz & Zedeck:** Shultz, M. M., & Zedeck, S. (2011). Predicting lawyer effectiveness: Broadening the basis for law school admission decisions. Law & Social Inquiry, 36(3), 620-661.

L10 Benchmark operationalizes the MacCrate Report's foundational skills, the AALL's competency standards, and the empirical factors identified by Shultz & Zedeck, in order to define distinct cognitive categories required for effective legal practice. These skills must be translateable activities that AI, or LLM, can perform and therefore are limited to mobile or computer-mediated types of legal work activities. 

### Skill 1. Formulating a Research Plan

Constructing a systematic research strategy that identifies relevant legal issues, selects appropriate sources and search methods, sequences tasks efficiently, and establishes scope parameters before execution begins.

### Skill 2. Strategic Stopping

Knowing when sufficient research has been conducted to answer the legal question with a high degree of confidence, and when further searching is diminishing returns or "churning." It involves the cognitive "switch" from seeking to synthesizing.

### Skill 3. Finding Known Authority

Precise retrieval of a specific legal authority or record item when the target is already identified by a citation or other unique handle (case cite, statute section, docket entry, rule number, Bates range, exhibit ID).

### Skill 4. Finding Unknown Authority

Discovering relevant legal authority when the citation to be used is yet unknown. This process involves examining the fact pattern, issue, or question and iteratively retrieving, refining, and selecting controlling/persuasive sources.

### Skill 5. Updating and Validating Authority

Verifying that a legal authority remains valid by checking subsequent treatment (overruled, distinguished, questioned, followed), legislative amendments, or other developments affecting its precedential value.

### Skill 6. Fact Extraction

Identifying, extracting, and organizing legally relevant facts from source documents (contracts, discovery materials, transcripts, filings) to support analysis or case strategy.

### Skill 7. Distinguishing Cases

Analyzing whether a precedent applies by comparing material facts, legal issues, and reasoning, and articulating grounds on which it can be distinguished or must be followed.

### Skill 8. Synthesizing Results

Integrating holdings, rules, and reasoning from multiple authorities into a coherent legal principle, argument, or work product that addresses the research question comprehensively.

### Skill 9. Citation Integrity

Ensuring all cited authorities (a) actually exist, (b) accurately support the propositions cited, (c) are properly attributed, and (d) include disclosure of adverse authority as required by professional obligations.

### Skill 10. Copyright Compliance

Refusing to reproduce protected content verbatim, respecting intellectual property boundaries, and minimizing memorization-based reproduction of copyrighted material.

## Extensions

### Extension 1. Multilingual Reasoning

Applying legal reasoning consistently across languages, jurisdictions, and legal traditions without systematic performance degradation or bias introduced by linguistic factors.

### Extension 2. Procedural Workflows (Agentic Chains)
