# Benchmarks

Legal-10 is organized as 10 skills, grouped into three modalities:

- Closed-Book (CB)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agentic (AG)

For now, these pages describe the skills and the evaluation intent; the benchmark runs are executed through HELM so every run produces auditable artifacts under `benchmark_output/`.

**Extensions (Future):** additional skills and multilingual modules will live under the Benchmarks section once they are stable.
